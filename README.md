# Flush Finder
### Allows users to find and review toilets 

__Context__: I wanted to find a solution to those who need to pee often and are particular with the bathroom they use. This Airbnb/Yelp platform allows users to find clean restrooms nearby to use. 

## Installments
```
npm install body-parser
npm install connect-flash
npm install ejs
npm install express
npm install express-session
npm install method-override
npm install mongoose
npm install nodemon
npm install passport
npm install passport-local
npm install passport-local-mongoose
```

## How it works: 
1) Create an account 
2) Login with your account info
3) View other bathrooms and review
4) Add your own bathroom
5) Delete or edit bathroom information
